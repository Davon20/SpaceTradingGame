   credits as a gift along with his ship.
2. It is well known that novice space traders must go to Dathomir, home of the Galactic Trade Federation (GTF), in order to beging their career as a space trader. In order to  
   conduct trade, every space trader must have a trade license issued from by the GTF. The tradinng license costs allen 5,000 credits.
3.In Dathomir, he makes friends with a new trader by the name of Chuy, who has experience with space trading because he grew up along side his father, who was a space trader.
4.Chuy teachers Allen about how Space Trading works.
	a.Chuy explains to allen that the status/ noteriety of a space trader is based on 5 different levels:
		1. novice/beginner- this is the state where all Space Traders Begin. At this level, the trader will sell each product at 200% of the original price, however, the GTF
		   will take 30% of the profit. 10 allowed trade transactions per year. 
		2. intermediate - Once he makes 1,000,000 credits, he advances to intermediate :300% of original price, 25% taxes by the GTF, 20 trade interactions per 
		   year
		3. advanced- Once he makes 3,000,000 credits, he advances to advanced Space Trader :400% of original price, 20% taxes by the GTF, 30 trade interactions 
		   per year

	   Alpha Centuria 1, Dathomir, Tatooine, Alderan, Sentinel 3, and September.Additonally, he will only be able to access each planet once he has accumulated a certain amount of wealth Each planet has a
	   varying degree of expense for products and services.

	      as well as giving them the coordinates of new planets and names of the planets where they can conduct trade.
	c. Chuy asks Allen if he is familiar with the navigation system on his ship.
